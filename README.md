# Spacebook_App
Spacebook is an App for the Mobile App Development Course. Essentially it is a Facebook Clone - that is made in RN (React Native). 
React Native allows the app to be created  - using an API - for a web service. 

This code follows the guidelines provided by Linter - which allows syntactical errors (grammatical coding error) and this lead me to iron out and polish my code as much as I could.
Linter allowed me to keep away from many major errors as a result. Code Alignment was decent as a result.

This code also follows the AirBnB Style Guide - so some of the features I tried to utilise are:
1- PascalCase is used for File names.
2- camelCase is used for the react variables and components that are utilized.
3- JSX Tags (Attributes) are wrapped and are encased in brackets (parentheses) - when there are spread over multiple lines.

Also, Regex was utilised for validation of passwords - traits like:
\/d/ , /[A-Z]/\ were used to enable me to add password constraints of Integer Digit Values and Capitalized Letters - as well as the Character limits for passwords.

Issues that I am aware of: 
1 - The API does not allow the User to like/unlike their own posts - making it and essentiality that the endpoint is met via viewing a friends' profile and therefore their post.
